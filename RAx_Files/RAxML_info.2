Alignment has 10 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 0.00%

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 2 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
Alignment Patterns: 10
Name: No Name Provided
DataType: DNA
Substitution Matrix: GTR




RAxML was called as follows:

raxmlHPC -f a -x12345 -p 12345 -# 2 -m GTRGAMMA -s windows\window10.phylip -n 2
